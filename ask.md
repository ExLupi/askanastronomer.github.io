You can ask a question for [our team](/about) below. We will answer your astronomy-related question within a few days. You will receive your answer via email (coming from the email address askanastronomer@astro.as.utexas.edu).

Please keep your question short and focused (*tell us everything you know about black holes!*: not good, *why do stars turn into black holes?*: good!). The most interesting questions will be published anonymously on our website.
