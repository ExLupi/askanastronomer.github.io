You can ask a question for [our team](/about) below. We will answer your astronomy-related question within one to two weeks. You will receive your answer via email. Please check your spam folder if you don't hear back from us within two weeks. **We can't guarantee we will answer every single question.**

#### Rules
1. Keep your question short and focused (*tell us everything you know about black holes!*: not good, *why do stars turn into black holes?*: good!).
2. Only ask one question at a time. 
3. We typically do not answer questions about what's visible in the night sky, or about amateur telescopes. Please contact your local [astronomy club](/links) or check out our [links](/links).
4. We do not answer homework questions.
5. The most interesting questions will be published anonymously on our website.
