You can ask a question for [our team](/about) below. We will answer your astronomy-related question within one to two weeks. You will receive your answer via email. Please check your spam folder if you don't hear back from us within two weeks.

Please keep your question short and focused (*tell us everything you know about black holes!*: not good, *why do stars turn into black holes?*: good!). For general questions about amateur telescopes and equipment, or what's visible in the night sky, please contact your local [astronomy club](http://www.austinastro.org) or check out our [links](/links).

The most interesting questions will be published anonymously on our website.
