We are a team of graduate students and postdocs affiliated with the [University of Texas](http://as.utexas.edu) and [McDonald Observatory](http://mcdonaldobservatory.org). We welcome questions about Astronomy from K-12 students, teachers and the general public!

Please use the [Ask a Question](/ask) form to ask our team a question about Astronomy. We try to answer all questions within a few days. Please keep your questions short and focused (*tell us everything you know about black holes!*: not good, *why do stars turn into black holes?*: good).
