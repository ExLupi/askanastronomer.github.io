**Is Jupiter a failed star?**

I study how
stars and planets form, which is a big part of the ways that Jupiter
both is and isn't like a star.

We can consider Jupiter to look somewhat like a "failed star" because
it actually has a chemical composition that is very similar to the
Sun. Jupiter is mostly hydrogen and helium, with only a small fraction
of any heavier elements. This means that if Jupiter was heavier, then
it could undergo fusion (the source of energy in the Sun) and radiate
its own light. However, Jupiter is too light, and its central
temperature never got high enough for hydrogen fusion to start.

(I'll note that Jupiter actually looks quite a bit different from
stars, but that's because it's so cool that a little bit of the
hydrogen goes into making molecules like ammonia (NH3), methane (CH4),
and even heavier hydrocarbons. The Sun is so hot that almost all
molecules get broken up, so you only have hydrogen and other atoms.)

The fact that Jupiter has the same composition as the Sun actually
tells us something interesting about how it formed - that is, it must
have formed at the same time as the Sun, out of the same cloud of gas.
However, that brings us to the key difference between stars (like the
Sun) and planets (like Jupiter). When a star (and its planets) form,
the whole cloud collapses. Due to the conservation of "angular
momentum" (i.e., the rate the material is spinning), the collapsing
cloud spins up, and some of the material can't fall all the way down
to the star. This material instead becomes a disk orbiting around the
star, and planets condense out of that disk. I think the best way of
distinguishing between stars and planets is to ask if they were the
central object in one of the big condensing blobs, or formed in the
disk around some (much more massive) central object.

It's worth noting that this can be a subtle distinction! We see many
objects floating around out in the Milky Way that are actually quite
small, such that they also never ignited fusion. We call these "brown
dwarfs". An emerging result in astronomy is to realize that you can
make those objects in the same way as a star, that have a mass that is
maybe even as low as Jupiter's. So these objects would look totally
identical to Jupiter, but perhaps they really should be regarded as
"star-like objects" and not "planet-like objects".

This causes some arguments among astronomers, because we don't know
which term to use for them! We're still working out whether to define
a "planet" as any object less than some critical mass (which we can at
least measure), or to try defining it based on how they form (which is
more scientific, but often hard to determine). I lean toward the
second option, but stay tuned, because the answer to this question
could continue to change in the future!
